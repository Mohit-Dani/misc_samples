Welcome to Larry's Paint. This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">free</FONT> Java
applet program that allows you to make various paintings. You can draw two
ways. A simple way of drawing is to use premade images, called stamps, to
put in your painting. The other way to draw, is by hand, using a coloring
pen. Your paintings can even have a background. The program comes with stamps
and backgrounds, however you are able to change them to your own images.
This program can be used in a small way to display&nbsp;a slide show that
you can annotate.
<P>
I have tested it in Netscape 4.7 &amp; Internet Explorer 5.0. It requires
the latest versions, since it uses Java 1.1.

Select a drawing mode from the list on the left. The 3 modes are: Pen, Stamp
or background. Selecting background will erase the drawing and replace it
with a background.
<P>
To draw with the pen, click the mouse in the applet to press the pen down.
Now keep the mouse button down and drag the mouse to make the pen draw a
line. You can change the pen color at any time, while in Pen mode.
<P>
In Stamp or Background mode, give the program a few seconds after making
your selection, for it to load.
<P>
To use a stamp, move the mouse to the location you want to place the stamp
and press the mouse button. You can place the stamp more than once in your
painting. To choose another stamp, select the number of the stamp you want.
<P>
To use a background, select a number for the background. The background erases
your painting, and gives it a new background.
<P>
If you want to start over, you can erase everything. The Clear button erases
everything, including the background.
<P>
The applet has no print function. You'll have to capture the screen and print
it out.
<P>
To print in Windows 95 or higher:
<P>
To capture the contents of the screen, press PRINT SCREEN.<BR>
Now go to Paint or any other image program and paste the image to print it
out. Paint is found in Start/Programs/Accessories/Paint.
<P>
For the Mac do:
<P>
command-shift-3, the screen is saved as "picture 1", or another numbered
PICT file in the root level of your hard drive for you to print. The new
Mac OS has command-shift-4, to select the area saved. I don't use a Mac,
and I got these instructions from a newsgroup. If they don't work for you,
check with someone that knows the Mac.

As I mentioned before, you can use your own images for the stamps and the
background. The file names correspond to the number choices. The stamps are
the file names stamp1.gif through stamp10.gif. The background file names
are back1.jpg to back10.jpg. The reason for gif for the stamps, and jpg for
the background, is because the stamps could be transparent, and only gif
does that. Since the background takes up the full size of the canvas, I figured
jpgs are better for that. You may want to copy the applet's class files
(<B>lgpaint.class</B>, <B>lgcanvas.class, paintselect.class, clear.class,
gethelp.class, help.class</B>) and html file (<B>lgpaint.html</B>) to a new
directory for each set of your own images.
<P>
If you need to use this as a small slide show, you can set the background
images to be the slides. Then if you are in Background mode, you can select
the slide to be displayed. If you switch to Color mode, you can make annotations
on the screen.
<P>
The size of the applet is determined by it's size in the HTML code, you can
change it by editing the value of the width and height in the applet's tag.
<P>
&lt;!-- Adjust the width and height of the applet here. --&gt;<BR>
&lt;applet code=lgpaint.class width=600 height=300 &gt;
<P>
Open up the <B>lgpaint.html</B> file in an editor and change the size of
the applet. The background image is resized to fit on the canvas of the applet.
Because of the menu bar, the image's height is about 10% less than the applet's
height. If you look at the Java Console in your browser, you will see the
canvas size there. This will help you make your backgrounds the correct
size.
